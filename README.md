Hello there!

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning repo! This is all the coursework completed for the Udacity Nanodegree Program. [Here's](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/PG5E2ND) the certificate.

If you navigate to [RL_LearningDoc](https://github.com/alvanli/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/RL_LearningDoc.pdf), you will find some summary I typed out to refresh my memory.

Each subfolder contains a separate project, and they all have their Report.pdf which details the models used, and the goals of the models. 

Have a nice day!
